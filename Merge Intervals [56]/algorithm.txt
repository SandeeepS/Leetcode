step 1 : Sort intervals by start time (ascending order)

step 2 : Initialize result array and track current merged interval

step 3 : Iterate through sorted intervals:

step 4 : If current interval overlaps with previous (curr[0] <= prev[1]), extend previous

step 5 : Else, add previous to result and start new current interval

step 6 : Add final interval to result
