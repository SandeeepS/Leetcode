step 1 : create a new node and point to the existing head
         
         let newNode = new ListNode(1,head);

step 2 : create a dymmy pointer that point to new node;

        let dummy = newNode;
    
step 3 : move the head using for loop , until  i < n 

        for(let i = 0 ; i < n ; i++){
            head = head.next;
        }

        - this is the main logic of the problem 
          we are using a dummy pointer in the next step , and going to move the head again along with the dummy pointer parallelly ,
          by doing that , when the head reach the end of the list , the dummy will reach the just before the target node . then we can 
          change the pointer.

step 4 : again loop until head reach the end of the list , along withe the head , move dummy , so dummy will reach the just before the target node 

        - while(head){
                head = head.next;
                dummy = dummy.next;
            }

step 5 : change the pointer from the target node to the node after the target node 

        - dummy = dummy.next.next;
    
step 6 : return the head, for that we can use 

        - return newNode.next;
